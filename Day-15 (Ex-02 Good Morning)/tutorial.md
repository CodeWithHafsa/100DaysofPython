# Excersice 2: Good Morning Sir
Create a python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening. Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

```python
import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%M')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%S')
print(timestamp)
```

Output:
```
11:58:34
11
58
34
```
