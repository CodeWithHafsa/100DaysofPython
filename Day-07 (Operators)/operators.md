# Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.


# Arithmetic operators

|   Operator             |Operator Name                          |Example                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|+|`Addition`            |``` 15+7 ```            |
|-|`Subtraction`            |``` 15-7 ```            |
|*|`Multiplication`            |``` 5*7 ```            |
|**|`Exponential`            |``` 5**3 ```            |
|/|`Division`            |``` 5/3 ```            |
|%|`Modulus`            |``` 15%7 ```            |
|//|`Floor Division`            |``` 15//7 ```            |

# Exercise
```python
n = 5
m = 6
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)

ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)

ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)

ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)

ans5 = n%m #percent answer mein remainder deyga = Modulus Operator
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)

ans6 = n//m #double slash answer se point remove kardeyga = Floor diviion operator
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)

ans7 = n**m #exponent operator
print("Exponent Operator of",n,"and",m,"is", ans7)
```

Output:
```markup
Addition of 5 and 6 is 11
Subtraction of 5 and 6 is -1
Multiplication of 5 and 6 is 30
Division of 5 and 6 is 0.8333333333333334
Modulus of 5 and 6 is 5
Floor Division of 5 and 6 is 0
Exponent Operator of 5 and 6 is 125
```
# Explaination
Here 'n' and 'm' are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables 'ans1' , 'ans2' ,'ans3', 'ans4','ans5' and 'ans6' contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.
